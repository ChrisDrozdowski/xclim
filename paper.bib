	abstract = {This study assesses the changes in the exceedances of joint extremes of temperature and precipitation quantiles for a number of sites in Europe. The combination of cool/dry, cool/wet, warm/dry and warm/wet modes reveals a systematic change at all locations investigated in the course of the 20th century, with significant declines in the frequency of occurrence of the “cold” modes and a sharp rise in that of the “warm” modes. The changing behavior of these four modes is also accompanied by changes in the particular conditions of temperature and precipitation associated with each mode; for example, the average amount of precipitation during cool/wet events decreases while that during warm/wet events increases, even though mean precipitation at most locations shows no significant trend. In a “greenhouse climate”, the “cool” modes are almost totally absent by 2100 whereas the warm/dry and warm/wet modes pursue the progression already observed in the 20th century.},

	abstract = {Public health planning needs the support of evidence-based information on current and future climate, which could be used by health professionals and decision makers to better understand and respond to the health impacts of extreme heat. Climate models provide information regarding the expected increase in temperatures and extreme heat events with climate change and can help predict the severity of future health impacts, which can be used in the public health sector for the development of adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. This study analyzes the evolution of extreme temperature indices specifically defined to characterize heat events associated with health risks, in the context of a changing climate. The analysis is performed by using temperature projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model. A quantile-based statistical correction is applied to the projected temperatures, in order to reduce model biases and account for the representativeness error. Moreover, generalized Pareto distributions are used to extend the temperature distribution upper tails and extrapolate the statistical correction to extremes that are not observed in the present but that might occur in the future. The largest increase in extreme daytime temperatures occurs in southern Manitoba, Canada, where the already overly dry climate and lack of soil moisture can lead to an uncontrolled enhancement of hot extremes. The occurrence of warm nights and heat waves, on the other hand, is already large and will increase substantially in the communities of the Great Lakes region, characterized by a humid climate. Impact and adaptation studies need to account for the temperature variability due to local effects, since it can be considerably larger than the model natural variability.},

@article{robinson_nition_2001,
	title = {On the {Deﬁnition} of a {Heat} {Wave}},
	volume = {40},
	abstract = {Heat waves are a major cause of weather-related deaths. With the current concern for global warming it is reasonable to suppose that they may increase in frequency, severity, duration, or areal extent in the future. However, in the absence of an adequate deﬁnition of a heat wave, it is impossible to assess either changes in the past or possible consequences for the future. A set of deﬁnitions is proposed here, based on the criteria for heat stress forecasts developed by the National Weather Service (NWS). Watches or warnings are issued when thresholds of daytime high and nighttime low heat index (Hi) values are exceeded for at least two consecutive days. The heat index is a combination of ambient temperature and humidity that approximates the environmental aspect of the thermal regime of a human body, with the NWS thresholds representing a generalized estimate of the onset of physiological stress. These thresholds cannot be applied directly nationwide. In hot and humid regions, physical, social, and cultural adaptations will require that the thresholds be set higher to ensure that only those events perceived as stressful are identiﬁed. In other, cooler, areas the NWS criteria may never be reached even though unusually hot events may be perceived as heat waves. Thus, it is likely that a similar number of perceived heat events will occur in all regions, with the thresholds varying regionally. Hourly Hi for 178 stations in the coterminous United States was analyzed for the 1951–90 period to determine appropriate threshold criteria. Use of the NWS criteria alone indicated that much of the nation had less than three heat waves per decade, and this value was adopted as the baseline against which to establish suitable thresholds. For all areas, a percentile threshold approach was tested. Using all available data, daytime high and nighttime low thresholds were established separately for each speciﬁc percentile. Heat waves were treated as occurring when conditions exceeded both the daytime high and the nighttime low thresholds of the same percentile for two consecutive days. Several thresholds were tested. For much of the South, 1\% thresholds produced appropriate values. Consequently, a heat wave was deﬁned as a period of at least 48 h during which neither the overnight low nor the daytime high Hi falls below the NWS heat stress thresholds (80Њ and 105ЊF, respectively), except at stations for which more than 1\% of both the annual high and low Hi observations exceed these thresholds, in which case the 1\% values are used as the heat wave thresholds. As an extension, ‘‘hot spells’’ were similarly deﬁned, but for events falling between the 1\% values and NWS thresholds, with ‘‘warm spells’’ occurring between the 2\% and 1\% values. Again, stations for which the 1\% or 2\% Hi values exceed the NWS thresholds were given modiﬁed deﬁnitions. The preliminary investigation of the timing and location of heat waves resulting from these deﬁnitions indicated that they correctly identiﬁed major epidemiological events. A tentative climatic comparison also suggests that heat waves are becoming less frequent in the southern and more frequent in the midwestern and eastern parts of the nation.},
